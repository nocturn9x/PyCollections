# PyCollections
PyCollections is a Python 3 library that implements some useful containers (tuples, dictionaries, lists)


### Note

You can find the package also on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/PyCollections/), though that page will be updated only when a bunch of minor fixes are made to this repo, so if you want to have always the latest (development) version of PyCollections you should check this repository, too.
